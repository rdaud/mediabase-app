# About Mediabase App

Mediabase is a full stack web application fully developed by me while I worked at R/GA. It's an internal tool meant to streamline the work process between Creative and Media departments.

# Stack

React / Redux / MongoDB / JWT

# Contributions

• Implemented the backend server with Node.js
• Used Postman to create and validate all CRUDE operations of the API
• Used Redux for handling state management of the platform
• Implemented database with MongoDB to store all user data, such as credentials and data created in the platform
• Implemented the front-end by first coding all the components based in the design system and then coding the pages itself
