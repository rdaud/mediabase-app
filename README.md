# About Mediabase App

Mediabase is a full stack web application created by the Experience Design team and fully developed by me when I worked at R/GA São Paulo. It's an internal tool meant to streamline the work process between Creative and Media departments.

# Stack

JWT Auth / MongoDB / Node.js / React / Redux

# Contributions

• Implemented the backend server with Node.js
• Used Postman to create and validate all CRUDE operations of the API
• Used Redux for handling state management of the platform
• Implemented database with MongoDB to store all user data, such as credentials and data created in the platform
• Implemented the front-end by first coding all the components based in the design system and then coding the pages itself
